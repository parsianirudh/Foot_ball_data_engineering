This Python-based project uses Apache Airflow to crawl football data from Wikipedia. The data is cleaned and transformed using Pandas before being pushed to Azure Data Lake for scalable storage. Processed data is then loaded into a PostgreSQL database for complex analysis and reporting. The entire pipeline ensures automated, efficient, and accurate data handling for football analytics.
